This directory contains a number of different 1D forcing files used to force the land surface model CLM in ParFlow.

Each file consists of eight space separated columns with the following atmospheric variables

SW LW P Ta U V Pbar Qs

where

SW: Short wave radiation (W/m2)

LW: Long wave radiation (Wm/2)

P: Precipitation (mm/s)

Ta: Air temperature at reference height (K)

U: Lat wind speed (m/s)

V: Long wind speed (m/s)

Pbar: Barometric pressure (hPa)

Qs: Specific humidity (kg/kg)
